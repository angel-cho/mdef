Hybrid Profiles Personal Development Program Reflections \u00b6 What is my fight? In our first week of MDEF program, we met the faculties, visited the facilities and the Poblenou neighborhood, and was introduced to the structure of the program. Our first exercise was to reflect on the question \u201cWhat is my fight?\u201d and create a poster to share with the group. In my poster, I visualized my journey through my personal and professional life in the context of technology. I chose the lens of technology because it had and continues to have a large impact it on my personal life, our culture and society, my design career, and our collective future. In summary, I grew up with the evolution of technology and the internet and have had very mixed feeling about the ethics of technology. At different times of my life, I embraced and rejected working with or buying into the culture of tech, but have now come to a place where I see technology as a tool I must understand and manipulate to make impact in the future. And I believe the best way technology has made an impact in our society is through elevating equality; by providing new opportunities and access to marginalized communities and individuals who may not have had access before. Hybrid Profiles We learned about designing from a first person perspective and the importance of engaging with community early on in our design process. The sample (India light) project project was a great example of how as designers, we are often \u201csolving\u201d design problems in our own heads and ultimately designing for ourselves instead of the actual client or audience. We often fall into the trap of seeing ourselves as creators and problem solvers and the world as a big problem we need to solve. When the reality is that our minds our limited and the connections and sparks we can generate through real-life engagement and interactions (people, places and things), can provide a depth of understanding, relevance, and unimagined pathways that we could not have thought of alone. Following this lecture, we learned about the importance of understanding ourselves (our skills, knowledge and attitudes) on a professional level, and our aspirations. We jotted down our professional identities, then shared our qualities with our classmates, one on one. With each share, I learned a new quality of a classmate and picked up a quality that I would like to have. This exercise provided a good platform to share about ourselves in ways that we normally wouldn\u2019t. \u201cThe professional identity is deduced from the role you typically take in a design process, your strengths and weaknesses as a designer.

Listening to Mariana\u2019s personal journey, I found her perspective on technological metaphors interesting. In particular the idea that human culture is embedded in all aspects of our creation, including technology. And this is something worth looking at and reflecting on. On day 2 we went on a hike in Collserola Natural Park, on the outskirts of Barcelona. We picked a card to take with us and reflect on during our hike; I chose \u201cEmotional Tech\u201d. The hike was full of positive surprises, we explored unmarked trails, tasted wild berries, identified plants, exchanged stimulating conversations, walked in silence, and received an amazing talk from a park ranger about the natural habitat of the area. My takeaways: - I thought the relationship of the city to the forest was important. Living in a capitalistic society, we have the tendency to want to build, expand, and grow. And this is mostly the outlook of any city. But how does this affect the ecosystem and other species that have previously lived in the urban areas or currently live around it? - I had never thought about the visual significance of something vs nothing in terms of \u2026 I had never thought about the importance of scale in determining what we see as valuable. The park ranger brought up the topic of humans building on empty fields because they see the empty land and see it as an opportunity to build something on. Vs. when they see a forest, they see trees and larger species that need to be preserved or saved. When actually, the fields help the biodivesity of the birds and etc. These kinds of revelations really shift my perspective. - how can we discourage people from moving to cities. interesting topic to have post covid, when a lot of people have been migrating to the countrysides after remote work became a long-term possibility. Emotional technology - when technologies learn and recognize human emotions and use that knowledge to improve outputs and services. Using biometric data and connecting products to eachother - keep thinking about what the point of it all is. What do we mean when we say \u201cbetter\u201d experience or world. Do we define \u201cbetter\u201d as easier or more convenient? If everything is more convenient, are we missing out on the revelations and discoveries that inconvenience and random curve balls life throws us? My 1:1 meeting with Mariana was valuable although I wish we had more time. I was encouraged that she was interested in my work and thought that my past work and interests and what I had in mind to pursue was in alignment. It\u2019s super valuable to get different perspectives because other people with other experiences can sometimes make the connection that I\u2019m not able to in my mind. And open doors to explore new connections. Being indecisive, it was difficult to choose a few cards from the myriad of interesting topics. But this was a great exercise to practice making intuitive decisions. Sometimes I forget the knowledge I have built through experience that exists on a subconscious level and depend too much on my thinking process. I chose \u201cFight Anthropocene Conflicts\u201d because I was interested in issues created by humans that humans suffer. \u201cInter-species Collaboration\u201d because I am interested in how and what we can learn from other species. This exercise was tricky. I found myself googling a lot of terms ![](../images/Miro_Multiscalar.jpg) * Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. The importance of getting your hands dirty, ![](../images/Miro_CollabSpace.jpg) In our collaboration exercise, was good to hear other\u2019s perspectives. I feel like we spent most of the time trying to negotiate our definitions of the group. Everyone had something slightly different in mind and wanted to get on the same page. I think it\u2019s really difficult to let go of your personal identity or ideas esp in this world today where our identities are\u2026 It reminds me of a zen story: when a group of hippies arrived at the San Francisco Zen Center in the 70\u2019s, the senior monk, Suzuki Roshi told them to get out of their individual clothing and and accessories and change into shaved heads and black robes.
