Hybrid Profiles Personal Development Program Reflections What is my fight? In our first week of MDEF program, we met the faculties, visited the facilities and the Poblenou neighborhood, and was introduced to the structure of the program. Our first exercise was to reflect on the question \u201cWhat is my fight?\u201d and create a poster to share with the group. In my poster, I visualized my journey through my personal and professional life in the context of technology. I chose the lens of technology because it had and continues to have a large impact it on my personal life, our culture and society, my design career, and our collective future. In summary, I grew up with the evolution of technology and the internet and have had very mixed feeling about the ethics of technology. At different times of my life, I embraced and rejected working with or buying into the culture of tech, but have now come to a place where I see technology as a tool I must understand and manipulate to make impact in the future. And I believe the best way technology has made an impact in our society is through elevating equality; by providing new opportunities and access to marginalized communities and individuals who may not have had access before. Hybrid Profiles We learned about designing from a first person perspective and the importance of engaging with community early on in our design process. The sample (India light) project project was a great example of how as designers, we are often \u201csolving\u201d design problems in our own heads and ultimately designing for ourselves instead of the actual client or audience. We often fall into the trap of seeing ourselves as creators and problem solvers and the world as a big problem we need to solve. When the reality is that our minds our limited and the connections and sparks we can generate through real-life engagement and interactions (people, places and things), can provide a depth of understanding, relevance, and unimagined pathways that we could not have thought of alone. blockquote \u201cThe professional identity is deduced from the role you typically take in a design process, your strengths and weaknesses as a designer. Your professional identity is constantly developing.\u201d - Oscar Tomico Following this lecture, we learned about the importance of understanding ourselves (our skills, knowledge and attitudes) on a professional level, and our aspirations. We jotted down our professional identities, then shared our qualities with our classmates, one on one. With each share, I learned a new quality of a classmate and picked up a quality that I would like to have. This exercise provided a good platform to share about ourselves in ways that we normally wouldn\u2019t.

Who are we? Which future? What are we talking about? Listening to Mariana\u2019s personal journey, I resonated with her insight in discovering human metaphors behind all aspects of technology. The example of the ancient memory board artifact was especially fascinating because it was so visually and conceptually similar to the circuit boards we make today. It made me feel humble and a part of something larger, in an ancestral lineage of humans that are working to create and preserve their stories. blockquote \u201cCognitive ecologies instead of cognitive supremacies\u201d - Mariana Quintero Design Space \u00b6 We were introduced to our design spaces on Miro, a working space we will be using throughout the program to map out our ideas, findings, experiments, and feedback. We started getting acquainted with this space through a card game. We had to pick a topic card we cared about, then blindly select a series of other topic cards, and create meaningful connections between the cards. Having the pre-written cards were helpful in giving form to abstract ideas. I enjoyed the format of the game, and thought it was a great way to engage and teach a system. On day 2 we went on a hike in Collserola Natural Park, on the outskirts of Barcelona. We were prompted to picked a card to take with us and reflect on during our hike. I chose \u201cEmotional Tech\u201d. I\u2019ve always seen this \u201cgreen area\u201d on google maps, but haven\u2019t made it out there yet so was excited to explore. Our early morning hike was full of surprises; we explored unmarked trails, tasted wild berries, identified new plants, exchanged ideas, walked in silence, and received a great talk from a park ranger at the peak of our hike. Some reflections from our conversation: Relationship of the city to the forest. Living in a capitalistic society, we have the tendency to want to build, expand, and grow our citites. But how does this affect the ecosystem and other species that have previously lived in the urban areas or currently live around it? The significance of seeing something vs \u201cnothing\u201d; for example a forest vs a field. I had never thought about the importance of visual scale in determining our values in this way. The park ranger brought up the topic of humans building on empty fields because they see the empty land as an opportunity to \u201cbuild on\u201d. In contrast, a forest full of trees and larger species is seen as something to be saved or preserved. But what we don\u2019t realize is that ecosystems and other organisms like birds depend on fields to feed and survive. How can we discourage people from moving to cities? This was an interesting topic to have post covid, when our view of workspace and home space have shifted tremendously. In the past year, many people have already migrated to the countrysides seeking nature, more space, and since remote work became a long-term possibility. My card: Emotional Technology \u00b6 I chose this card because the words resonated with me, but I didn\u2019t actually know its official meaning. After doing some research, I learned that Emotional Tech refers to technology that recognizes and uses human emotions (usually through biometric data) to improve their outputs and services. Some reflections I had during my day with this card: Can we use the input as emotions from other species besides humans? Shift the human-centered perspective How can emo tech improve our relationship with our surroundings The ways we relate to each other in a city environment What do we mean when we say \u201cbetter\u201d experience or world. Do we define \u201cbetter\u201d as easier or more convenient? If everything is more convenient, are we missing out on the revelations and discoveries that inconvenience and random curve balls life throws us? My Design Space \u00b6 Having so many great options, it was difficult to choose a few cards that represented my pursuit. I definitely resonate with the \u201chotel buffet syndrome\u201d as Mariana calls it. But I tried to remember to trust my instincts and make intuitive decisions. I chose the cards \u201cFight Anthropocene Conflicts\u201d and \u201cInter-species Collaboration\u201d because I\u2019m interested in the human-ness of these issues and also exploring other perspectives outside of the human species. In our collaboration exercise, was good to hear other\u2019s perspectives. I feel like we spent most of the time trying to negotiate our definitions of the group. Everyone had something slightly different in mind and wanted to get on the same page.

In my understanding, relational biology looks at biology in relation to, and not independent of, psychology and sociology. Ignatow goes on to outline the different biological systems that are in play within the MGB process: The ENS, BBB, Hormones and Neurotransmitters, and how each of these are affected by nutritional intake and in effect produce stress and psychiatric disorders. He outlines these as implications for an alternative way to understand and alter extreme social behaviors and psychiatric disorders. I believe this research is useful for the future because it looks at a wholistic (non-reductionist) way of approaching disease and social behaviors. Through food, it builds a connection that is tangible for most of us who may not understand what is going on inside our bodies, but suffer the effects of malnutrition. In order to get to the root of these issues, I believe we need to look at our bodies, minds, and environments holistically, and understand the chain of connections that come along with it. This is in contrast to the field of Western medicine, where issues in the body are studied and treated in isolation. I believe this wholistic and relational approach is applicable in any field of study: design, biology, technology ecology, agriculture, or sociology, as we are moving towards an understanding that everything is interconnected and impacts everything else. For example, in design we can look at industrial production and climate crisis. I thought this article was an interesting and important study in a step towards a more connected understanding of our bodies, minds, environments and behaviors. iGEM Experiment \u00b6 Mission \u00b6 To create a fabric that is able to generate and retain through embedding bacteria that\u2019s able to generate heat.

My table worked on a Auxitic Lactobacillus medium, which will only harbor lactobacillus bacteria. The recipe for this was fairly simple: milk and lemon and agar (to make a gel consistency). We sterilized the mediums in the pressure cooker, then used a Bunsen burner as a sterile zone to pour them into our petri dishes. microbiology, how to identify microorganisms, and we used this knowledge in practice by taking two mediums we made in the previous day (I chose lactobacillus and all purpose bacteria) and going out to find different samples to test on the mediums. For both these mediums, I sampled the inside of the Iaac toilet bowl, which looked surprisingly clean, and my armpits. I chose these two because I was interested if the toilet bowl would have lactobacillus bacteria, since it is in close contact with our bodies. And for my armpits, I was curious if there would be any lactobacillus and how much bacteria would show up. We labelled our samples and placed them in the incubator.

So we came to understand that having many samples to test will help focus in on defining the types of soil better.

Then fold the paper and put it in your pocket. Make something out of the scrap materials I brought to class for the person I drew. It can be for any function. Reflections \u00b6 We started working with materials before having an idea of what it would become. I had explored this mode of making before (in undergrad and in my design residency) and felt comfortable and ready to jump in. A few of the scrap materials I brought were: fabric yarn, clothes hangar, a net bag used to hold bell peppers from the grocery store, cardboard, a plastic bottle, and tea bags [ Fig.1 ]. I gravitated towards the net bag and the fabric because they were flexible (and colorful) materials and I started wrapping them around different objects [ Fig.4 ]. I enjoyed how the flexible materials were able to shift forms and create variations within the same object. I decided to focus on this element of \u201cvariations\u201d in output with a common input. I reflected of the 1 minute self portrait I had drawn, which I drew with my non-dominant hand and my eyes closed (so I can better connect with my true self, and also because I can\u2019t see myself anyways). The outcome of this drawing was a rough outline of my head with all of my features (eyes, nose, and mouth) drawn outside of my head [ Fig.2 ]. I decided this person didn\u2019t use speech or sight to communicate, and that I needed to build a tool for them to communicate with touch. In the end, I came up with two simple tools: the first one using the red net, paper clip, and a plastic bottle, and the second one using a clothes hanger and fabric yarn [ Fig.5 ]. Both of these objects you can interact with and transform the shape of the materials in different degrees and variations, similar to variations in sound for speech. Within my system, tactile variations of the object will determine the message I was communicating. For example, depending on how far the clothes hangar was stretched and how far the yarns are spaced out, it would communicate a message. We also realized as a group, our machines each touched upon a different human sense [ Fig.6 ]. In her feedback, Kristina observed themes our group had in common were \u201cbecoming\u201d and \u201cunfinished explorations\u201d. I resonated with this comment because what we had made seemed to reflect our aspirations more than a tool that would be useful. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 The New Me \u00b6 1PP one day experiment Goal: \u00b6 With an interest in accessibility in design, I wanted to gain first-hand insight into how accessible a daily life in Barcelona is for people with disabilities. To challenge myself, I committed to spending a day without speech, blurred vision, hard of hearing and poor manual dexterity. I hoped this experience would give me a small insight into understanding into the specific conveniences and inconveniences (in technology, human interaction, social transactions, navigations, etc.) in daily life in a city for people with disabilities. Here are ways I modified my senses for the day: Low, blurred vision I have poor vision (nearsighted) and always wear glasses to be able to see clearly. My vision on both eyes are around -3.5, which means the words I\u2019m typing on my computer screen start to get blurry if I sit straight up on my chair (1ft away). The further away something is from me, it is more blurred and less defined. For recordings I made, I used hand sanitizer on a clear plastic container lid and taped it to my phone camera lens to simulate what I was seeing (actually a bit worse) Hard of hearing I used earplugs in both of my ears to block out loud noises. ( \u201cearplugs typically have an NRR between 22 dB to 33 dB.\u201d - sleep foundation.org) Without Speech Committing to not speaking today. I have a feeling this sense will be the easiest transition for me, especially when I am alone and in a foreign country. I will need to challenge myself by inserting myself into social environments where speech is necessary. Lack of Hand Coordination Using my non-dominant hand (left) to write today. Video: \u00b6 You can see the video on youtube here: https://youtu.be/Gk0xrloH7m0 Field Notes: \u00b6 **9:44am** \u2014 I couldn't see my cat, Chicken, anywhere around our apartment and thought he could have jumped off the balcony. So I got scared and I started running to the corners of our small apartment looking for him. I really wanted to call out his name ****like I usually would when I can't find him. He doesn't always respond, but still it's something you do when you lose something that can hear. Since my sight wasn't good, I couldn't see very clearly in the dark closet and under the bed, and had to feel around with my hands. I thought I need to make a sound that would be appealing to him, so I went and got out a crinkly cat toy which made a loud noise. No response. I got a bag of treats and shook it vigorously (he lives for treats), no response. I became frustrated I couldn't make any sound... But I finally recalled his favorite (my least favorite) napping place, which is a drawer in the bathroom where we keep the fresh laundered towels. And sure enough, there he was. Because I couldn't see well, I touched him to confirm it was him. **10:15am** \u2014 I heard a noise coming from the bathroom, and I ran there and saw brown stuff on top of the toilet seat, which I knew was dirt (context), and my cat Chicken (oval grey thing), running out of the bathroom. I followed after him and he ran under the bed (because he knew he did something bad). I wanted to scold him and say, \"chicken, no! Bad boy!\", which is what I usually do when he does something bad, but I couldn't use my voice, so I just slapped the ground with my hand as an expression of my frustration and to make a loud noise for him to hear. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4743.jpg) **11:30am** \u2014 I realize my home has become too safe, so I decided to go on a walk and expose myself and see what other challenges I run into in the wild. I thought since speech is a very social tool, I needed to engage in social environments. So I texted the MDEF group chat to see if anyone wanted to join me on a walk through the city. Paula, Paula, Georges, and Borka responded. And I planned to meet Georges in Poblenou to start. I will be leaving my glasses home, despite my discomfort, so I can fully commit and not retreat to it when I become uncomfortable. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4901.png) **13:00h** - Went out of the house to meet Geroge at Iaac. Vision was the sense I was relying on most heavily here. It was difficult trying to avoid stepping on poop on the ground, since I had trouble seeing. Normally, I would cross the street on a red light if there were no cars passing. *I noticed myself relying a lot on other people on the street (since they were large masses and could easily be seen) watching other people to see if I should cross the street on a red light*. I reinserted my ear plugs properly and I can hear significantly less. With my earplugs in, it was harder to identify sounds and the distance of the sounds. **13:06h** - Waiting for George outside of Iaac, it\u2019s difficult to see the faces of people who are approaching. I keep looking at them wondering if it\u2019s him, and it probably looks strange. I feel glad I wore my sunglasses, it makes me feel safer and less seen. **13:11h** - Ordering coffee. I showed the sign that says \"No Puedo Hablar Hoy\" and pointed at the word \u201ccortado\" on the menu. He understood and gave me a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and proceeded with the transaction as normal but without saying anything. The card reader didn\u2019t work so he banged on the other ones and for some reason I understood that as frustration towards me. This transaction made me self conscious. **13:18h** - I start feeling uncomfortable walking in silence and feel like I need to say something. We walk to Cituidella park to meet up with Paula. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4786.jpg) **14:40h** - We find a cafe near the Arc de Triumph to grab some food, charge our phone, and join the class online. Ordering food: I get a sense that the workers here do not expect that I cannot speak, hear or see well. When I showed her the sign, I got the sense that she was a bit annoyed. I had to take some time to write what I wanted to order on the piece of paper because I was using my non-dominant hand. She left the counter for a few seconds and then returned when I finished. I showed her the piece of paper to order a sandwich and a juice. **15:10h** - We took class on iPad at a cafe. I found myself moving closer to the iPad because I couldn\u2019t hear very well and when people were commenting, I had to move close to see what the text was. Aparna commented on my look through a personal text, which made me feel silly. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4800.jpg) **15:30h** - A man came up and asked for something in Spanish, I couldn\u2019t understand but I also couldn\u2019t respond with sound. Helpless I looked at Paula, and she looked up and shook her head and said \u201cno\u201d **15:36h** - We decided to head out and walk towards Audrey's kitchen before it starts raining. Being in a busy part of town, we passed by many stores that looked interesting but I couldn\u2019t read the signs, and that *made me frustrated.* Normally, I would look up the store names as I pass by them on my google map and pin them so I can return to them in the future. I felt like I was missing out on future pleasures. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4806.jpg) **15:53h** - I asked Paula if the metro ticket was okay (to use for the bus) and she misunderstood me suggesting she uses my metro ticket too. I understood her misunderstanding through what she said, but *I wasn\u2019t fast enough* to communicate this to her by typing it on my phone. I let it go. **16:34h** \u2014 We are now out in Saint Antoni to come to Audrey\u2019s kitchen. We joined Mariana and Audrey here. With more than one person around, I'm finding it more difficult to insert myself in a group setting. Conversations are happening really fast and reactively, and I'm not finding time for me to chime in. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/audreyskitchen.jpg) **16:17h** - I saw Paula touching all of the figs on the table and I wanted to tell her not to touch all of the figs. I couldn't scold her with my voice so I tapped her hands (gently) but firmly, letting her know that it's not okay. It was taken with a sense of humor and we laughed about it. I wrote \"you dirty hands\" on the piece of paper with my non-dominant hand and showed it to her. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4823.jpg) **17:17h** - We decided to go to a bubble tea shop. As we were walking, we lost Audrey and I was the only one who saw her walk the other way. I wanted to yell at her to let her to get her attention, but I couldn\u2019t. Instinctively, I started snapping my fingers like I did with the cats this morning, but it wasn't loud enough. I panicked a little *I felt helpless* and ran towards Paula and marina to tap their shoulders to let them know and they called her. *It was frustrating.* **17:25h** - It's 5 minutes before my 1:1 meeting with Angella and the Zoom app on my phone isn't working. Paula, Mariana, and Audrey are inside a boba shop. I hurry in and tap the shoulder of Audrey who is the closest to the door and hand her my phone where I typed \"Can I use your phone for the meeting? Mine isn't working\". She said her batteries were low and she called out to Marina, who gave me her phone to use. **17:30h** - Meeting with Angella. I showed her my sign (in english) and she started writing a sign to show me. I messaged her in chat and told her we should talk in chat for the sake of time, and she asked me if it was okay if others can see it. I said I didn't mind and we continued our conversation through chat. I told her what I was doing and asked her if she knew any American Sign Language. She told me she knew \"milk\" and \"more\". She mostly stayed silent and communicated with chat although she was able to speak back to me over the call. At the end of the call she said, \"Bye, Marina\" and I realized that she had thought I was Marina because I was using her phone. I wasn't quick enough with typing to let her know before I left the call. *I was frustrated that she mistook me as Marina and I felt helpless that I couldn't say anything to correct her misunderstanding.* I decided to deal with it later in an e-mail message. **17:47h** - Ordering boba. This was my third time interacting with a service employee, so I knew exactly what to do. I wrote what I wanted to order beforehand while I stood in line and prepared my credit card and my sign. When I was up to order, I showed my sign \"Yo Puedo No Hablo\", and he asked me \"why?\". I didn't expect him to interact with me in this way and I took a moment to write \"experiment\" (very poorly) with my non-dominant hand. I showed him the word and he gave me a thumbs up. I responded with a thumbs up and showed him the paper with my order on it. He grabbed my paper (which I also didn't expect) and wrote something on it himself. He returned the paper to me and I saw he had written \"4.20 Euros\", what I owed him. I paid with credit card and went outside to reflect on these few unexpected responses. I typed it out to Audrey and she suggested that he might have been aware that I wasn't actually deaf because she was filming me the whole time. *I hadn't thought about this before. By having someone film me for the final video, I was communicating that this was a set up (inauthentic) experience.* **19:00h** - It\u2019s harder to see as it becomes dark and I have my sunglasses on. I chose to keep them on in order to fully commit to my experiment and walked home in the blurry darkness. *I felt significantly less safe, unable to see clearly and hear clearly.* It made me realize how much I rely on these sens Pain Points & Observations: \u00b6 What are my major observations and issues that came up today? The mobile phone was HUGELY useful to me in every aspect during the day. I held it in my hand constantly and used it as a live tool to communicate with the people around me, to enhance and enlarge images that I couldn\u2019t see (were too far away), etc. Also, at the sandwich shop, it was hard to see the digital menu that was far away. In this case, I used my mobile phone to view and enhance the images live. I noticed how much I rely on reactive and responsive communication, like sounds of acknowledgement and affirmation. And how much communication is not necessarily about the meat of the content, but all of the \u201cstuff\u201d around it. I noticed myself compensating by nodding a lot and making my gestures larger than usual (to be seen) and also lots of \u201cthumbs up\u201d. Getting people\u2019s attention. I didn\u2019t know how Observing how different people react to me in different always (from my perception). Some people were uncomfortable, some were helpful and tried to overcompensate to communicate, some were annoyed, some were curious and interested, some mimicked me, and some found it difficult to talk with me, knowing that I won\u2019t respond back verbally. Reflections: \u00b6 (\u201cA guide to successful auto-ethnography\u201d by Andres Lucero\u2019s article) 1. Define study boundaries (being able to describe the limits of the study) See \u201cGoals\u201d above 2. Authentictiy (construct validity, being personally involved) I was fully committed to the parameters of the study from 9am to 9pm, and in that way, I felt I was authentic towards my project. However, the premise of my study (an able bodied person pretending to be a disabled body) inherently has issues of authenticity embedded in it. I think everyone I interacted with knew in some way that I was not actually deaf or hard of hearing. The worker at the boba shop even asked me \u201cwhy?\u201d when I showed him the paper that I could not speak today. The other factor is that I was being recorded, which gave away the message that something performative was happening. 3. Plausibility or scholarship (it relates to current research, trends,\u2026) In the design and exhibit design industries which I\u2019ve worked in, there is a lack of research and focus on accessibility design. Although it is a requirement in the U.S. to comply with ADA policies when working in a 3D space, and the ADA regulations on virtual spaces are becoming more restrictive, it is not a priority for most companies. I think that as able bodied people and designers, we fundamentally have a huge hole in our understanding of what it\u2019s like to navigate the world with disabilities. And most of the time, we are designing for other people like us. I think my study can act as an experimental research or activity in understanding the pain points, in where design can improve, and also give an alternative perspective to the way things should be designed. 4. Criticality (instrumental utility, imagining ways of thinking and acting differently) I think this point is asking for a critical reflection on my study\u2026 In that case, I think I would have limited the technology or tool I was using to communicate with others more intentionally, so I can better understand the experience of using a specific thing. I would have put more focus on a few factors and observed these throughout the day. 5. Slef-revealing communication (communicate in an open and transparent way without filtering or changing what happened) I did not filter most of my field notes, except for a few areas where it was notes on specific people who I didn\u2019t want to make uncomfortable. My experiences are left unfiltered and I think this is valuable because it is the content that I\u2019m examining in my study. 6. Ethnographic material with confessional content (personal material to be limited to relevant information in relation to the research subject) For this study, it was important for me to not filter my personal notes and experiences because the goal was to understand the general experience. In the next study, I would like to focus more deeply on a specific element of usability or accessibility, and in that case, I would focus less on my general reflections and more on relevant research. 7. Generalizability (does it relate to others, can it be meaningful for others?) I think this study can be meaningful for others because it\u2019s essentially asking someone to spend a day in someone else\u2019s shoes, someone who is very different from you. It\u2019s important to understand that the goal of my study is not to say I understand what it\u2019s like to be disabled, but rather to give a deeper insight into experiences that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get through other non-experiential means (reading, interviews, observing). Making ourselves vulnerable is the best and most direct way to feel and understand a concept.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/04_Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Week 5 / 02-05 November 2021 / Oscar Tomico , Kristina Andersen, Angella Mackey","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/04_Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#workshop","text":"Take one minute to draw a self portait on a small piece of paper.

I had explored this mode of making before (in undergrad and in my design residency) and felt comfortable and ready to jump in. A few of the scrap materials I brought were: fabric yarn, clothes hangar, a net bag used to hold bell peppers from the grocery store, cardboard, a plastic bottle, and tea bags [ Fig.1 ]. I gravitated towards the net bag and the fabric because they were flexible (and colorful) materials and I started wrapping them around different objects [ Fig.4 ]. I enjoyed how the flexible materials were able to shift forms and create variations within the same object. I decided to focus on this element of \u201cvariations\u201d in output with a common input. I reflected of the 1 minute self portrait I had drawn, which I drew with my non-dominant hand and my eyes closed (so I can better connect with my true self, and also because I can\u2019t see myself anyways). The outcome of this drawing was a rough outline of my head with all of my features (eyes, nose, and mouth) drawn outside of my head [ Fig.2 ]. I decided this person didn\u2019t use speech or sight to communicate, and that I needed to build a tool for them to communicate with touch. In the end, I came up with two simple tools: the first one using the red net, paper clip, and a plastic bottle, and the second one using a clothes hanger and fabric yarn [ Fig.5 ]. Both of these objects you can interact with and transform the shape of the materials in different degrees and variations, similar to variations in sound for speech. Within my system, tactile variations of the object will determine the message I was communicating. For example, depending on how far the clothes hangar was stretched and how far the yarns are spaced out, it would communicate a message. We also realized as a group, our machines each touched upon a different human sense [ Fig.6 ]. In her feedback, Kristina observed themes our group had in common were \u201cbecoming\u201d and \u201cunfinished explorations\u201d.

Authentictiy (construct validity, being personally involved) I was fully committed to the parameters of the study from 9am to 9pm, and in that way, I felt I was authentic towards my project. However, the premise of my study (an able bodied person pretending to be a disabled body) inherently has issues of authenticity embedded in it. I think everyone I interacted with knew in some way that I was not actually deaf or hard of hearing. The worker at the boba shop even asked me \u201cwhy?\u201d when I showed him the paper that I could not speak today. The other factor is that I was being recorded, which gave away the message that something performative was happening. 3. Plausibility or scholarship (it relates to current research, trends,\u2026) In the design and exhibit design industries which I\u2019ve worked in, there is a lack of research and focus on accessibility design. Although it is a requirement in the U.S. to comply with ADA policies when working in a 3D space, and the ADA regulations on virtual spaces are becoming more restrictive, it is not a priority for most companies. I think that as able bodied people and designers, we fundamentally have a huge hole in our understanding of what it\u2019s like to navigate the world with disabilities. And most of the time, we are designing for other people like us. I think my study can act as an experimental research or activity in understanding the pain points, in where design can improve, and also give an alternative perspective to the way things should be designed. 4. Criticality (instrumental utility, imagining ways of thinking and acting differently) I think this point is asking for a critical reflection on my study\u2026 In that case, I think I would have limited the technology or tool I was using to communicate with others more intentionally, so I can better understand the experience of using a specific thing. I would have put more focus on a few factors and observed these throughout the day. 5. Slef-revealing communication (communicate in an open and transparent way without filtering or changing what happened) I did not filter most of my field notes, except for a few areas where it was notes on specific people who I didn\u2019t want to make uncomfortable. My experiences are left unfiltered and I think this is valuable because it is the content that I\u2019m examining in my study. 6. Ethnographic material with confessional content (personal material to be limited to relevant information in relation to the research subject) For this study, it was important for me to not filter my personal notes and experiences because the goal was to understand the general experience. In the next study, I would like to focus more deeply on a specific element of usability or accessibility, and in that case, I would focus less on my general reflections and more on relevant research. 7. Generalizability (does it relate to others, can it be meaningful for others?) I think this study can be meaningful for others because it\u2019s essentially asking someone to spend a day in someone else\u2019s shoes, someone who is very different from you. It\u2019s important to understand that the goal of my study is not to say I understand what it\u2019s like to be disabled, but rather to give a deeper insight into experiences that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get through other non-experiential means (reading, interviews, observing). Making ourselves vulnerable is the best and most direct way to feel and understand a concept.","title":"Reflections:"},{"location":"seminars/05_Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/","text":"Living with Your Own Ideas \u00b6 Week 5 / 02-05 November 2021 / Oscar Tomico , Kristina Andersen, Angella Mackey Workshop \u00b6 Take one minute to draw a self portait on a small piece of paper. Then fold the paper and put it in your pocket. Make something out of the scrap materials I brought to class for the person I drew. It can be for any function. Reflections \u00b6 We started working with materials before having an idea of what it would become. I had explored this mode of making before (in undergrad and in my design residency) and felt comfortable and ready to jump in. A few of the scrap materials I brought were: fabric yarn, clothes hangar, a net bag used to hold bell peppers from the grocery store, cardboard, a plastic bottle, and tea bags [ Fig.1 ]. I gravitated towards the net bag and the fabric because they were flexible (and colorful) materials and I started wrapping them around different objects [ Fig.4 ]. I enjoyed how the flexible materials were able to shift forms and create variations within the same object. I decided to focus on this element of \u201cvariations\u201d in output with a common input. I reflected of the 1 minute self portrait I had drawn, which I drew with my non-dominant hand and my eyes closed (so I can better connect with my true self, and also because I can\u2019t see myself anyways). The outcome of this drawing was a rough outline of my head with all of my features (eyes, nose, and mouth) drawn outside of my head [ Fig.2 ]. I decided this person didn\u2019t use speech or sight to communicate, and that I needed to build a tool for them to communicate with touch. In the end, I came up with two simple tools: the first one using the red net, paper clip, and a plastic bottle, and the second one using a clothes hanger and fabric yarn [ Fig.5 ]. Both of these objects you can interact with and transform the shape of the materials in different degrees and variations, similar to variations in sound for speech. Within my system, tactile variations of the object will determine the message I was communicating. For example, depending on how far the clothes hangar was stretched and how far the yarns are spaced out, it would communicate a message. We also realized as a group, our machines each touched upon a different human sense [ Fig.6 ]. In her feedback, Kristina observed themes our group had in common were \u201cbecoming\u201d and \u201cunfinished explorations\u201d. I resonated with this comment because what we had made seemed to reflect our aspirations more than a tool that would be useful. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 The New Me \u00b6 1PP one day experiment Goal: \u00b6 With an interest in accessibility in design, I wanted to gain first-hand insight into how accessible a daily life in Barcelona is for people with disabilities. To challenge myself, I committed to spending a day without speech, blurred vision, hard of hearing and poor manual dexterity. I hoped this experience would give me a small insight into understanding into the specific conveniences and inconveniences (in technology, human interaction, social transactions, navigations, etc.) in daily life in a city for people with disabilities. Here are ways I modified my senses for the day: Low, blurred vision I have poor vision (nearsighted) and always wear glasses to be able to see clearly. My vision on both eyes are around -3.5, which means the words I\u2019m typing on my computer screen start to get blurry if I sit straight up on my chair (1ft away). The further away something is from me, it is more blurred and less defined. For recordings I made, I used hand sanitizer on a clear plastic container lid and taped it to my phone camera lens to simulate what I was seeing (actually a bit worse) Hard of hearing I used earplugs in both of my ears to block out loud noises. ( \u201cearplugs typically have an NRR between 22 dB to 33 dB.\u201d - sleep foundation.org) Without Speech Committing to not speaking today. I have a feeling this sense will be the easiest transition for me, especially when I am alone and in a foreign country. I will need to challenge myself by inserting myself into social environments where speech is necessary. Lack of Hand Coordination Using my non-dominant hand (left) to write today. Video: \u00b6 You can see the video on youtube here: https://youtu.be/Gk0xrloH7m0 Field Notes: \u00b6 **9:44am** \u2014 I couldn't see my cat, Chicken, anywhere around our apartment and thought he could have jumped off the balcony. So I got scared and I started running to the corners of our small apartment looking for him. I really wanted to call out his name ****like I usually would when I can't find him. He doesn't always respond, but still it's something you do when you lose something that can hear. Since my sight wasn't good, I couldn't see very clearly in the dark closet and under the bed, and had to feel around with my hands. I thought I need to make a sound that would be appealing to him, so I went and got out a crinkly cat toy which made a loud noise. No response. I got a bag of treats and shook it vigorously (he lives for treats), no response. I became frustrated I couldn't make any sound... But I finally recalled his favorite (my least favorite) napping place, which is a drawer in the bathroom where we keep the fresh laundered towels. And sure enough, there he was. Because I couldn't see well, I touched him to confirm it was him. **10:15am** \u2014 I heard a noise coming from the bathroom, and I ran there and saw brown stuff on top of the toilet seat, which I knew was dirt (context), and my cat Chicken (oval grey thing), running out of the bathroom. I followed after him and he ran under the bed (because he knew he did something bad). I wanted to scold him and say, \"chicken, no! Bad boy!\", which is what I usually do when he does something bad, but I couldn't use my voice, so I just slapped the ground with my hand as an expression of my frustration and to make a loud noise for him to hear. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4743.jpg) **11:30am** \u2014 I realize my home has become too safe, so I decided to go on a walk and expose myself and see what other challenges I run into in the wild. I thought since speech is a very social tool, I needed to engage in social environments. So I texted the MDEF group chat to see if anyone wanted to join me on a walk through the city. Paula, Paula, Georges, and Borka responded. And I planned to meet Georges in Poblenou to start. I will be leaving my glasses home, despite my discomfort, so I can fully commit and not retreat to it when I become uncomfortable. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4901.png) **13:00h** - Went out of the house to meet Geroge at Iaac. Vision was the sense I was relying on most heavily here. It was difficult trying to avoid stepping on poop on the ground, since I had trouble seeing. Normally, I would cross the street on a red light if there were no cars passing. *I noticed myself relying a lot on other people on the street (since they were large masses and could easily be seen) watching other people to see if I should cross the street on a red light*. I reinserted my ear plugs properly and I can hear significantly less. With my earplugs in, it was harder to identify sounds and the distance of the sounds. **13:06h** - Waiting for George outside of Iaac, it\u2019s difficult to see the faces of people who are approaching. I keep looking at them wondering if it\u2019s him, and it probably looks strange. I feel glad I wore my sunglasses, it makes me feel safer and less seen. **13:11h** - Ordering coffee. I showed the sign that says \"No Puedo Hablar Hoy\" and pointed at the word \u201ccortado\" on the menu. He understood and gave me a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and proceeded with the transaction as normal but without saying anything. The card reader didn\u2019t work so he banged on the other ones and for some reason I understood that as frustration towards me. This transaction made me self conscious. **13:18h** - I start feeling uncomfortable walking in silence and feel like I need to say something. We walk to Cituidella park to meet up with Paula. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4786.jpg) **14:40h** - We find a cafe near the Arc de Triumph to grab some food, charge our phone, and join the class online. Ordering food: I get a sense that the workers here do not expect that I cannot speak, hear or see well. When I showed her the sign, I got the sense that she was a bit annoyed. I had to take some time to write what I wanted to order on the piece of paper because I was using my non-dominant hand. She left the counter for a few seconds and then returned when I finished. I showed her the piece of paper to order a sandwich and a juice. **15:10h** - We took class on iPad at a cafe. I found myself moving closer to the iPad because I couldn\u2019t hear very well and when people were commenting, I had to move close to see what the text was. Aparna commented on my look through a personal text, which made me feel silly. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4800.jpg) **15:30h** - A man came up and asked for something in Spanish, I couldn\u2019t understand but I also couldn\u2019t respond with sound. Helpless I looked at Paula, and she looked up and shook her head and said \u201cno\u201d **15:36h** - We decided to head out and walk towards Audrey's kitchen before it starts raining. Being in a busy part of town, we passed by many stores that looked interesting but I couldn\u2019t read the signs, and that *made me frustrated.* Normally, I would look up the store names as I pass by them on my google map and pin them so I can return to them in the future. I felt like I was missing out on future pleasures. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4806.jpg) **15:53h** - I asked Paula if the metro ticket was okay (to use for the bus) and she misunderstood me suggesting she uses my metro ticket too. I understood her misunderstanding through what she said, but *I wasn\u2019t fast enough* to communicate this to her by typing it on my phone. I let it go. **16:34h** \u2014 We are now out in Saint Antoni to come to Audrey\u2019s kitchen. We joined Mariana and Audrey here. With more than one person around, I'm finding it more difficult to insert myself in a group setting. Conversations are happening really fast and reactively, and I'm not finding time for me to chime in. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/audreyskitchen.jpg) **16:17h** - I saw Paula touching all of the figs on the table and I wanted to tell her not to touch all of the figs. I couldn't scold her with my voice so I tapped her hands (gently) but firmly, letting her know that it's not okay. It was taken with a sense of humor and we laughed about it. I wrote \"you dirty hands\" on the piece of paper with my non-dominant hand and showed it to her. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4823.jpg) **17:17h** - We decided to go to a bubble tea shop. As we were walking, we lost Audrey and I was the only one who saw her walk the other way. I wanted to yell at her to let her to get her attention, but I couldn\u2019t. Instinctively, I started snapping my fingers like I did with the cats this morning, but it wasn't loud enough. I panicked a little *I felt helpless* and ran towards Paula and marina to tap their shoulders to let them know and they called her. *It was frustrating.* **17:25h** - It's 5 minutes before my 1:1 meeting with Angella and the Zoom app on my phone isn't working. Paula, Mariana, and Audrey are inside a boba shop. I hurry in and tap the shoulder of Audrey who is the closest to the door and hand her my phone where I typed \"Can I use your phone for the meeting? Mine isn't working\". She said her batteries were low and she called out to Marina, who gave me her phone to use. **17:30h** - Meeting with Angella. I showed her my sign (in english) and she started writing a sign to show me. I messaged her in chat and told her we should talk in chat for the sake of time, and she asked me if it was okay if others can see it. I said I didn't mind and we continued our conversation through chat. I told her what I was doing and asked her if she knew any American Sign Language. She told me she knew \"milk\" and \"more\". She mostly stayed silent and communicated with chat although she was able to speak back to me over the call. At the end of the call she said, \"Bye, Marina\" and I realized that she had thought I was Marina because I was using her phone. I wasn't quick enough with typing to let her know before I left the call. *I was frustrated that she mistook me as Marina and I felt helpless that I couldn't say anything to correct her misunderstanding.* I decided to deal with it later in an e-mail message. **17:47h** - Ordering boba. This was my third time interacting with a service employee, so I knew exactly what to do. I wrote what I wanted to order beforehand while I stood in line and prepared my credit card and my sign. When I was up to order, I showed my sign \"Yo Puedo No Hablo\", and he asked me \"why?\". I didn't expect him to interact with me in this way and I took a moment to write \"experiment\" (very poorly) with my non-dominant hand. I showed him the word and he gave me a thumbs up. I responded with a thumbs up and showed him the paper with my order on it. He grabbed my paper (which I also didn't expect) and wrote something on it himself. He returned the paper to me and I saw he had written \"4.20 Euros\", what I owed him. I paid with credit card and went outside to reflect on these few unexpected responses. I typed it out to Audrey and she suggested that he might have been aware that I wasn't actually deaf because she was filming me the whole time. *I hadn't thought about this before. By having someone film me for the final video, I was communicating that this was a set up (inauthentic) experience.* **19:00h** - It\u2019s harder to see as it becomes dark and I have my sunglasses on. I chose to keep them on in order to fully commit to my experiment and walked home in the blurry darkness. *I felt significantly less safe, unable to see clearly and hear clearly.* It made me realize how much I rely on these sens Pain Points & Observations: \u00b6 What are my major observations and issues that came up today? The mobile phone was HUGELY useful to me in every aspect during the day. I held it in my hand constantly and used it as a live tool to communicate with the people around me, to enhance and enlarge images that I couldn\u2019t see (were too far away), etc. Also, at the sandwich shop, it was hard to see the digital menu that was far away. In this case, I used my mobile phone to view and enhance the images live. I noticed how much I rely on reactive and responsive communication, like sounds of acknowledgement and affirmation.

Bad boy!\", which is what I usually do when he does something bad, but I couldn't use my voice, so I just slapped the ground with my hand as an expression of my frustration and to make a loud noise for him to hear. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4743.jpg) **11:30am** \u2014 I realize my home has become too safe, so I decided to go on a walk and expose myself and see what other challenges I run into in the wild. I thought since speech is a very social tool, I needed to engage in social environments. So I texted the MDEF group chat to see if anyone wanted to join me on a walk through the city. Paula, Paula, Georges, and Borka responded. And I planned to meet Georges in Poblenou to start. I will be leaving my glasses home, despite my discomfort, so I can fully commit and not retreat to it when I become uncomfortable. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4901.png) **13:00h** - Went out of the house to meet Geroge at Iaac. Vision was the sense I was relying on most heavily here. It was difficult trying to avoid stepping on poop on the ground, since I had trouble seeing. Normally, I would cross the street on a red light if there were no cars passing. *I noticed myself relying a lot on other people on the street (since they were large masses and could easily be seen) watching other people to see if I should cross the street on a red light*. I reinserted my ear plugs properly and I can hear significantly less. With my earplugs in, it was harder to identify sounds and the distance of the sounds. **13:06h** - Waiting for George outside of Iaac, it\u2019s difficult to see the faces of people who are approaching. I keep looking at them wondering if it\u2019s him, and it probably looks strange. I feel glad I wore my sunglasses, it makes me feel safer and less seen. **13:11h** - Ordering coffee. I showed the sign that says \"No Puedo Hablar Hoy\" and pointed at the word \u201ccortado\" on the menu. He understood and gave me a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and proceeded with the transaction as normal but without saying anything. The card reader didn\u2019t work so he banged on the other ones and for some reason I understood that as frustration towards me. This transaction made me self conscious. **13:18h** - I start feeling uncomfortable walking in silence and feel like I need to say something. We walk to Cituidella park to meet up with Paula. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4786.jpg) **14:40h** - We find a cafe near the Arc de Triumph to grab some food, charge our phone, and join the class online. Ordering food: I get a sense that the workers here do not expect that I cannot speak, hear or see well. When I showed her the sign, I got the sense that she was a bit annoyed. I had to take some time to write what I wanted to order on the piece of paper because I was using my non-dominant hand. She left the counter for a few seconds and then returned when I finished. I showed her the piece of paper to order a sandwich and a juice. **15:10h** - We took class on iPad at a cafe. I found myself moving closer to the iPad because I couldn\u2019t hear very well and when people were commenting, I had to move close to see what the text was. Aparna commented on my look through a personal text, which made me feel silly. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4800.jpg) **15:30h** - A man came up and asked for something in Spanish, I couldn\u2019t understand but I also couldn\u2019t respond with sound. Helpless I looked at Paula, and she looked up and shook her head and said \u201cno\u201d **15:36h** - We decided to head out and walk towards Audrey's kitchen before it starts raining. Being in a busy part of town, we passed by many stores that looked interesting but I couldn\u2019t read the signs, and that *made me frustrated.* Normally, I would look up the store names as I pass by them on my google map and pin them so I can return to them in the future. I felt like I was missing out on future pleasures. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4806.jpg) **15:53h** - I asked Paula if the metro ticket was okay (to use for the bus) and she misunderstood me suggesting she uses my metro ticket too. I understood her misunderstanding through what she said, but *I wasn\u2019t fast enough* to communicate this to her by typing it on my phone. I let it go. **16:34h** \u2014 We are now out in Saint Antoni to come to Audrey\u2019s kitchen. We joined Mariana and Audrey here. With more than one person around, I'm finding it more difficult to insert myself in a group setting. Conversations are happening really fast and reactively, and I'm not finding time for me to chime in. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/audreyskitchen.jpg) **16:17h** - I saw Paula touching all of the figs on the table and I wanted to tell her not to touch all of the figs. I couldn't scold her with my voice so I tapped her hands (gently) but firmly, letting her know that it's not okay. It was taken with a sense of humor and we laughed about it. I wrote \"you dirty hands\" on the piece of paper with my non-dominant hand and showed it to her. ![](../images/04_lwyoi/IMG_4823.jpg) **17:17h** - We decided to go to a bubble tea shop. As we were walking, we lost Audrey and I was the only one who saw her walk the other way. I wanted to yell at her to let her to get her attention, but I couldn\u2019t. Instinctively, I started snapping my fingers like I did with the cats this morning, but it wasn't loud enough. I panicked a little *I felt helpless* and ran towards Paula and marina to tap their shoulders to let them know and they called her. *It was frustrating.* **17:25h** - It's 5 minutes before my 1:1 meeting with Angella and the Zoom app on my phone isn't working. Paula, Mariana, and Audrey are inside a boba shop. I hurry in and tap the shoulder of Audrey who is the closest to the door and hand her my phone where I typed \"Can I use your phone for the meeting? Mine isn't working\". She said her batteries were low and she called out to Marina, who gave me her phone to use. **17:30h** - Meeting with Angella. I showed her my sign (in english) and she started writing a sign to show me. I messaged her in chat and told her we should talk in chat for the sake of time, and she asked me if it was okay if others can see it. I said I didn't mind and we continued our conversation through chat. I told her what I was doing and asked her if she knew any American Sign Language. She told me she knew \"milk\" and \"more\". She mostly stayed silent and communicated with chat although she was able to speak back to me over the call. At the end of the call she said, \"Bye, Marina\" and I realized that she had thought I was Marina because I was using her phone. I wasn't quick enough with typing to let her know before I left the call. *I was frustrated that she mistook me as Marina and I felt helpless that I couldn't say anything to correct her misunderstanding.* I decided to deal with it later in an e-mail message. **17:47h** - Ordering boba. This was my third time interacting with a service employee, so I knew exactly what to do. I wrote what I wanted to order beforehand while I stood in line and prepared my credit card and my sign. When I was up to order, I showed my sign \"Yo Puedo No Hablo\", and he asked me \"why?\". I didn't expect him to interact with me in this way and I took a moment to write \"experiment\" (very poorly) with my non-dominant hand. I showed him the word and he gave me a thumbs up. I responded with a thumbs up and showed him the paper with my order on it. He grabbed my paper (which I also didn't expect) and wrote something on it himself. He returned the paper to me and I saw he had written \"4.20 Euros\", what I owed him. I paid with credit card and went outside to reflect on these few unexpected responses. I typed it out to Audrey and she suggested that he might have been aware that I wasn't actually deaf because she was filming me the whole time. *I hadn't thought about this before. By having someone film me for the final video, I was communicating that this was a set up (inauthentic) experience.* **19:00h** - It\u2019s harder to see as it becomes dark and I have my sunglasses on. I chose to keep them on in order to fully commit to my experiment and walked home in the blurry darkness. *I felt significantly less safe, unable to see clearly and hear clearly.* It made me realize how much I rely on these sens","title":"Field Notes:"},{"location":"seminars/05_Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#pain-points-observations","text":"What are my major observations and issues that came up today? The mobile phone was HUGELY useful to me in every aspect during the day. I held it in my hand constantly and used it as a live tool to communicate with the people around me, to enhance and enlarge images that I couldn\u2019t see (were too far away), etc. Also, at the sandwich shop, it was hard to see the digital menu that was far away. In this case, I used my mobile phone to view and enhance the images live. I noticed how much I rely on reactive and responsive communication, like sounds of acknowledgement and affirmation. And how much communication is not necessarily about the meat of the content, but all of the \u201cstuff\u201d around it. I noticed myself compensating by nodding a lot and making my gestures larger than usual (to be seen) and also lots of \u201cthumbs up\u201d. Getting people\u2019s attention. I didn\u2019t know how Observing how different people react to me in different always (from my perception). Some people were uncomfortable, some were helpful and tried to overcompensate to communicate, some were annoyed, some were curious and interested, some mimicked me, and some found it difficult to talk with me, knowing that I won\u2019t respond back verbally.","title":"Pain Points &amp; Observations:"},{"location":"seminars/05_Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#reflections_1","text":"(\u201cA guide to successful auto-ethnography\u201d by Andres Lucero\u2019s article) 1. Define study boundaries (being able to describe the limits of the study) See \u201cGoals\u201d above 2. Authentictiy (construct validity, being personally involved) I was fully committed to the parameters of the study from 9am to 9pm, and in that way, I felt I was authentic towards my project. However, the premise of my study (an able bodied person pretending to be a disabled body) inherently has issues of authenticity embedded in it. I think everyone I interacted with knew in some way that I was not actually deaf or hard of hearing. The worker at the boba shop even asked me \u201cwhy?\u201d when I showed him the paper that I could not speak today. The other factor is that I was being recorded, which gave away the message that something performative was happening. 3. Plausibility or scholarship (it relates to current research, trends,\u2026) In the design and exhibit design industries which I\u2019ve worked in, there is a lack of research and focus on accessibility design. Although it is a requirement in the U.S. to comply with ADA policies when working in a 3D space, and the ADA regulations on virtual spaces are becoming more restrictive, it is not a priority for most companies. I think that as able bodied people and designers, we fundamentally have a huge hole in our understanding of what it\u2019s like to navigate the world with disabilities. And most of the time, we are designing for other people like us. I think my study can act as an experimental research or activity in understanding the pain points, in where design can improve, and also give an alternative perspective to the way things should be designed. 4. Criticality (instrumental utility, imagining ways of thinking and acting differently) I think this point is asking for a critical reflection on my study\u2026 In that case, I think I would have limited the technology or tool I was using to communicate with others more intentionally, so I can better understand the experience of using a specific thing. I would have put more focus on a few factors and observed these throughout the day. 5. Slef-revealing communication (communicate in an open and transparent way without filtering or changing what happened) I did not filter most of my field notes, except for a few areas where it was notes on specific people who I didn\u2019t want to make uncomfortable. My experiences are left unfiltered and I think this is valuable because it is the content that I\u2019m examining in my study. 6. Ethnographic material with confessional content (personal material to be limited to relevant information in relation to the research subject) For this study, it was important for me to not filter my personal notes and experiences because the goal was to understand the general experience. In the next study, I would like to focus more deeply on a specific element of usability or accessibility, and in that case, I would focus less on my general reflections and more on relevant research. 7. Generalizability (does it relate to others, can it be meaningful for others?) I think this study can be meaningful for others because it\u2019s essentially asking someone to spend a day in someone else\u2019s shoes, someone who is very different from you. It\u2019s important to understand that the goal of my study is not to say I understand what it\u2019s like to be disabled, but rather to give a deeper insight into experiences that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get through other non-experiential means (reading, interviews, observing). Making ourselves vulnerable is the best and most direct way to feel and understand a concept.","title":"Reflections:"},{"location":"seminars/DS_Documentation%20Beyond%20Presentation%20copy/","text":"Documentation Beyond Presentation \u00b6 Week 6 / 08 November 2021 / Kate Armstrong Nikita\u2019s documenting device New Way of Documenting \u00b6 A reflection on how you are documenting and communicating your work currently, and how you will approach this moving forward in the master.
