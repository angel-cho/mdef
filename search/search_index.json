Born in South Korea and raised between two countries, she grew up immersed in traditional Eastern and modern Western cultures. Interested in social psychology and art from an early age, she decided to study graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design. This lead to her career in working for graphic design consultancies, teaching typography, and most recently, creating engaging interactive experiences for exhibition spaces. Parallel to her design career, Angel pursued less conventional paths in meditation and pottery. She studied under potters in Okinawa, Japan, and in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. She also formed a practice in zen meditation and the Japanese Tea Ceremony while living in a Buddhist Monastery in Northern California. She continues to find ways to weave these practices into her creative work. Angel is currently based in Barcelona, Spain, pursuing her Masters in Design for Emergent Futures at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia.

What is my fight? Through the prompt, \u201cWhat is my flight?\u201d, we reflected on topics and issues we cared about and want to explore further during our time here at MDEF. My process of thinking about this, I thought of my journey of coming here and joining this program. I listed down all of my influences and reflections since I was small and how that contextualizes my identity, my values, and the my thinking process. This map shows my relationship to technology in a linear journey from childhood (early 90\u2019s) to today (2021). I decided to focus on my relationship to technology because I realized that it really shaped my life in different ways, and continues to shape my life and our collective lives. Although it\u2019s not necessarily \u201cmy fight\u201d to think about technology, it was a good exercise in helping me come closer to what I might want to pursue. The best use of technology is for equality and providing tools of expression, communication, health, etc. to marginalized groups and individuals that may not have previously had access.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"04-08 October 2021 This first week of MDEF Bootcamp was an introduction of faculties, facilities, neighborhoods, communitites, and the structure and ideologies of the course.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
