Hybrid Profiles Personal Development Program Reflections What is my fight? In our first week of MDEF program, we met the faculties, visited the facilities and the Poblenou neighborhood, and was introduced to the structure of the program. Our first exercise was to reflect on the question \u201cWhat is my fight?\u201d and create a poster to share with the group. In my poster, I visualized my journey through my personal and professional life in the context of technology. I chose the lens of technology because it had and continues to have a large impact it on my personal life, our culture and society, my design career, and our collective future. In summary, I grew up with the evolution of technology and the internet and have had very mixed feeling about the ethics of technology. At different times of my life, I embraced and rejected working with or buying into the culture of tech, but have now come to a place where I see technology as a tool I must understand and manipulate to make impact in the future. And I believe the best way technology has made an impact in our society is through elevating equality; by providing new opportunities and access to marginalized communities and individuals who may not have had access before. Hybrid Profiles We learned about designing from a first person perspective and the importance of engaging with community early on in our design process. The sample (India light) project project was a great example of how as designers, we are often \u201csolving\u201d design problems in our own heads and ultimately designing for ourselves instead of the actual client or audience. We often fall into the trap of seeing ourselves as creators and problem solvers and the world as a big problem we need to solve. When the reality is that our minds our limited and the connections and sparks we can generate through real-life engagement and interactions (people, places and things), can provide a depth of understanding, relevance, and unimagined pathways that we could not have thought of alone. blockquote \u201cThe professional identity is deduced from the role you typically take in a design process, your strengths and weaknesses as a designer. Your professional identity is constantly developing.\u201d - Oscar Tomico Following this lecture, we learned about the importance of understanding ourselves (our skills, knowledge and attitudes) on a professional level, and our aspirations. We jotted down our professional identities, then shared our qualities with our classmates, one on one. With each share, I learned a new quality of a classmate and picked up a quality that I would like to have. This exercise provided a good platform to share about ourselves in ways that we normally wouldn\u2019t.

Who are we? Which future? What are we talking about? Listening to Mariana\u2019s personal journey, I resonated with her insight in discovering human metaphors behind all aspects of technology. The example of the ancient memory board artifact was especially fascinating because it was so visually and conceptually similar to the circuit boards we make today. It made me feel humble and a part of something larger, in an ancestral lineage of humans that are working to create and preserve their stories. blockquote \u201cCognitive ecologies instead of cognitive supremacies\u201d - Mariana Quintero Design Space \u00b6 We were introduced to our design spaces on Miro, a working space we will be using throughout the program to map out our ideas, findings, experiments, and feedback. We started getting acquainted with this space through a card game. We had to pick a topic card we cared about, then blindly select a series of other topic cards, and create meaningful connections between the cards. Having the pre-written cards were helpful in giving form to abstract ideas. I enjoyed the format of the game, and thought it was a great way to engage and teach a system. On day 2 we went on a hike in Collserola Natural Park, on the outskirts of Barcelona. We were prompted to picked a card to take with us and reflect on during our hike. I chose \u201cEmotional Tech\u201d. I\u2019ve always seen this \u201cgreen area\u201d on google maps, but haven\u2019t made it out there yet so was excited to explore. Our early morning hike was full of surprises; we explored unmarked trails, tasted wild berries, identified new plants, exchanged ideas, walked in silence, and received a great talk from a park ranger at the peak of our hike. Some reflections from our conversation: Relationship of the city to the forest. Living in a capitalistic society, we have the tendency to want to build, expand, and grow our citites. But how does this affect the ecosystem and other species that have previously lived in the urban areas or currently live around it? The significance of seeing something vs \u201cnothing\u201d; for example a forest vs a field. I had never thought about the importance of visual scale in determining our values in this way. The park ranger brought up the topic of humans building on empty fields because they see the empty land as an opportunity to \u201cbuild on\u201d. In contrast, a forest full of trees and larger species is seen as something to be saved or preserved. But what we don\u2019t realize is that ecosystems and other organisms like birds depend on fields to feed and survive. How can we discourage people from moving to cities? This was an interesting topic to have post covid, when our view of workspace and home space have shifted tremendously. In the past year, many people have already migrated to the countrysides seeking nature, more space, and since remote work became a long-term possibility. My card: Emotional Technology \u00b6 I chose this card because the words resonated with me, but I didn\u2019t actually know its official meaning. After doing some research, I learned that Emotional Tech refers to technology that recognizes and uses human emotions (usually through biometric data) to improve their outputs and services. Some reflections I had during my day with this card: Can we use the input as emotions from other species besides humans? Shift the human-centered perspective How can emo tech improve our relationship with our surroundings The ways we relate to each other in a city environment What do we mean when we say \u201cbetter\u201d experience or world. Do we define \u201cbetter\u201d as easier or more convenient? If everything is more convenient, are we missing out on the revelations and discoveries that inconvenience and random curve balls life throws us? My Design Space \u00b6 Having so many great options, it was difficult to choose a few cards that represented my pursuit. I definitely resonate with the \u201chotel buffet syndrome\u201d as Mariana calls it. But I tried to remember to trust my instincts and make intuitive decisions. I chose the cards \u201cFight Anthropocene Conflicts\u201d and \u201cInter-species Collaboration\u201d because I\u2019m interested in the human-ness of these issues and also exploring other perspectives outside of the human species. In our collaboration exercise, was good to hear other\u2019s perspectives. I feel like we spent most of the time trying to negotiate our definitions of the group.

Then fold the paper and put it in your pocket. Make something out of the scrap materials I brought to class for the person I drew. It can be for any function. Reflections \u00b6 We started working with materials before having an idea of what it would become. I had explored this mode of making before (in undergrad and in my design residency) and felt comfortable and ready to jump in. A few of the scrap materials I brought were: fabric yarn, clothes hangar, a net bag used to hold bell peppers from the grocery store, cardboard, a plastic bottle, and tea bags [ Fig.1 ]. I gravitated towards the net bag and the fabric because they were flexible (and colorful) materials and I started wrapping them around different objects [ Fig.4 ]. I enjoyed how the flexible materials were able to shift forms and create variations within the same object. I decided to focus on this element of \u201cvariations\u201d in output with a common input. I reflected of the 1 minute self portrait I had drawn, which I drew with my non-dominant hand and my eyes closed (so I can better connect with my true self, and also because I can\u2019t see myself anyways). The outcome of this drawing was a rough outline of my head with all of my features (eyes, nose, and mouth) drawn outside of my head [ Fig.2 ]. I decided this person didn\u2019t use speech or sight to communicate, and that I needed to build a tool for them to communicate with touch. In the end, I came up with two simple tools: the first one using the red net, paper clip, and a plastic bottle, and the second one using a clothes hanger and fabric yarn [ Fig.5 ]. Both of these objects you can interact with and transform the shape of the materials in different degrees and variations, similar to variations in sound for speech. Within my system, tactile variations of the object will determine the message I was communicating. For example, depending on how far the clothes hangar was stretched and how far the yarns are spaced out, it would communicate a message. We also realized as a group, our machines each touched upon a different human sense [ Fig.6 ]. Unfortunately, we were the last group to present and Kristina didn\u2019t have much time to give feedback. But in her short time, she observed themes our group had in common were \u201cbecoming\u201d and \u201cunfinished explorations\u201d. I resonated with this comment because what we had made seemed to reflect our aspirations more than a tool that would be useful. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 The New Me \u00b6 1PP one day experiment Goal: \u00b6 Since I am interested in accessibility in design, I decided to spend a day with lesser degrees of some of my core senses: sight, hearing, speech, and dexterity. I hoped this experience would give me a small insight into understanding what a daily life and activities are like with a person with disabilities. Here are the modifications I made to my senses: Low, blurred vision I have poor vision (nearsighted) and always wear glasses to be able to see clearly. My vision on both eyes are around -3.5, which means the words I\u2019m typing on my computer screen start to get blurry if I sit straight up on my chair (1ft away). I definitely can\u2019t recognize anyone\u2019s faces unless they are also 1ft away from me, unless I know the aesthetics and behaviors of the other person, which will help me recognize them by giving me some context. Otherwise the further an object is from me, the more it looks like a blur of color with no definition or outlines. Hard of hearing I used earplugs in both of my ears to block out loud noises. ( \u201cearplugs typically have an NRR between 22 dB to 33 dB.\u201d - sleep foundation.org) Connecting with other people relies heavily on language, and lose connection with other forms of communication and expression, which may sometimes be more profound and complex. I had a friend who was deaf when I was young and we all learned a bit of sign language to communicate with that person. Since then, I was interested in the concept of using our bodies and gesture as a method of communication. Last year during the pandemic, I took an American Sign Language (ASL) course in order to improve my sign language skills and especially during a time when everyone was wearing masks and it was difficult to communicate verbally and emotionally with others. Without Speech I have a feeling taking away my ability to speak for a day might be the easiest transition for me, especially when I am alone, in a foreign country, and not in a social environment. Maybe I will challenge myself and insert myself into environments where speech is required to communicate. Lack of Hand Coordination In my drawing practice this year, I worked on a project drawing 100 insects using my non-dominant hand and found tools. The purpose of using my non-dominant hand was to let go of my tendency for perfection and overthinking when it comes to creating. I believe this tendency comes from working with my right hand (left brain) in art and design for the past 20 years, when I began studying art in an academic setting, and in the past 10 years working as a designer in a professional setting. Also, working with the computer where everything is expected to be pixel perfect. I believe we always h Notes: \u00b6 Morning at home (8am-12pm) 9:44am \u2014 I couldn\u2019t see my cat, Chicken, anywhere around our apartment and thought he could have jumped off the balcony. So I got scared and I started running to the corners of our small apartment looking for him. I really wanted to call out his name ****like I usually would when I can\u2019t find him. He doesn\u2019t always respond, but still it\u2019s something you do when you lose something that can hear. Since my sight wasn\u2019t good, I couldn\u2019t see very clearly in the dark closet and under the bed, and had to feel around with my hands. I thought I need to make a sound that would be appealing to him, so I went and got out a crinkly cat toy which made a loud noise. No response. I got a bag of treats and shook it vigorously (he lives for treats), no response. I became frustrated I couldn\u2019t make any sound\u2026 But I finally recalled his favorite (my least favorite) napping place, which is a drawer in the bathroom where we keep the fresh laundered towels. And sure enough, there he was. Because I couldn\u2019t see well, I touched him to confirm it was him. am \u2014 I heard a noise coming from the bathroom, and I ran there and saw brown stuff on top of the toilet seat, which I knew was dirt (context), and my cat Chicken (oval grey thing), running out of the bathroom. I followed after him and he ran under the bed (because he knew he did something bad). I wanted to scold him and say, \u201cchicken, no! Bad boy!\u201d, which is what I usually do when he does something bad, but I couldn\u2019t use my voice, so I just slapped the ground with my hand as an expression of my frustration and to make a loud noise for him to hear. 11:30am \u2014 I realize my home has become too safe, so I decided to go on a walk and expose myself and see what other challenges I run into in the wild. I thought since speech is a very social tool, I needed to engage in social environments. So I texted the MDEF group chat to see if anyone wanted to join me on a walk through the city. Paula, Paula, Georges, and Borka responded. And I planned to meet Georges in Poblenou to start. I will be leaving my glasses home, despite my discomfort, so I can fully commit and not retreat to it when I become uncomfortable. 13:00h - Went out of the house to meet Geroge at Iaac. Vision was the sense I was relying on most heavily here. It was difficult trying to avoid stepping on poop on the ground, since I had trouble seeing. Normally, I would cross the street on a red light if there were no cars passing. I noticed myself relying a lot on other people on the street (since they were large masses and could easily be seen) watching other people to see if I should cross the street on a red light . I reinserted my ear plugs properly and I can hear significantly less. With my earplugs in, it was harder to identify sounds and the distance of the sounds. 13:06h - Waiting for George outside of Iaac, it\u2019s difficult to see the faces of people who are approaching. I keep looking at them wondering if it\u2019s him, and it probably looks strange. I feel glad I wore my sunglasses, it makes me feel safer and less seen. 13:11h - Ordering coffee. I showed the sign that says \u201cNo Puedo Hablar Hoy\u201d and pointed at the word \u201ccortado\u201d on the menu. He understood and gave me a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and proceeded with the transaction as normal but without saying anything. The card reader didn\u2019t work so he banged on the other ones and for some reason I understood that as frustration towards me. This transaction made me self conscious. 13:18h I think George is feeling uncomfortable. We walk to Cituidella park to meet up with Paula 14:12h Meet with Paula who is planting seeds around the city. 14:40h We find a cafe near the Arc de Triumph to grab some food, charge our phone, and join the class online. Ordering food: I get a sense that the workers here do not expect that I cannot speak, hear or see well. When I showed her the sign, I got the sense that she was a bit annoyed. I had to take some time to write what I wanted to order on the piece of paper because I was using my non-dominant hand. She left the counter for a few seconds and then returned when I finished. I ordered a sandwich and a juice and payed by card. 15:10h We took class on iPad at a cafe. I found myself moving closer to the iPad because I couldn\u2019t hear very well and when people were commenting, I had to move close to see what the text was. Aparna commented on my look through a personal text, which made me feel silly. 15:30h A man came up and asked for something in Spanish, I couldn\u2019t understand but I also couldn\u2019t respond with sound. Helpless I looked at Paula, and she looked up and shook her head and said \u201cno\u201d 15:36h We decided to head out and walk towards Audrey\u2019s kitchen before it starts raining. Being in a busy part of town, we passed by many stores that looked interesteing but I couldn\u2019t read the signs, and that made me frustrated. Normally, I would look up the store names as I pass by them on my google map and pin them so I can return to them in the future. I felt like I was missing out on future pleasures. 15:53h I asked Paula if the metro ticket was okay (to use for the bus) and she misunderstood me suggesting she uses my metro ticket too. I understood her misunderstanding through what she said, but I wasn\u2019t fast enough to communicate this to her by typing it on my phone. I let it go. 16:34h \u2014 We are now out in Saint Antoni to come to Audrey\u2019s kitchen. We joined Mariana and Audrey here. With more than one person around, I\u2019m finding it more difficult to insert myself in a group setting. Conversations are happening really fast and reactively, and I\u2019m not finding time for me to chime in. 16:17h - I saw Paula touching all of the figs on the table and I wanted to tell her not to touch all of the figs. I couldn\u2019t scold her with my voice so I tapped her hands (gently) but firmly, letting her know that it\u2019s not okay. It was taken with a sense of humor and we laughed about it. I wrote \u201cyou dirty hands\u201d on the piece of paper with my non-dominant hand and showed it to her. 17:17h We decided to go to a bubble tea shop. As we were walking, we lost Audrey and I was the only one who saw her walk the other way. I wanted to yell at her to let her to get her attention, but I couldn\u2019t. Instinctively, I started snapping my fingers like I did with the cats this morning, but it wasn\u2019t loud enough. I panicked a little I felt helpless and ran towards Paula and marina to tap their shoulders to let them know and they called her. It was frustrating. 17:25h It\u2019s 5 minutes before my 1:1 meeting with Angella and the Zoom app on my phone isn\u2019t working. Paula, Mariana, and Audrey are inside a boba shop. I hurry in and tap the shoulder of Audrey who is the closest to the door and hand her my phone where I typed \u201cCan I use your phone for the meeting? Mine isn\u2019t working\u201d. She said her batteries were low and she called out to Marina, who gave me her phone to use. 17:30h Meeting with Angella. I showed her my sign (in english) and she started writing a sign to show me. I messaged her in chat and told her we should talk in chat for the sake of time, and she asked me if it was okay if others can see it. I said I didn\u2019t mind and we continued our converstaion through chat. I told her what I was doing and asked her if she knew any American Sign Language. She told me she knew \u201cmilk\u201d and \u201cmore\u201d. She mostly stayed silent and communicated with chat although she was able to speak back to me over the call. At the end of the call she said, \u201cBye, Marina\u201d and I realized that she had thought I was Marina because I was using her phone. I wasn\u2019t quick enough with typing to let her know before I left the call. I was frustrated that she mistook me as Marina and I felt helpless that I couldn\u2019t say anything to correct her misunderstanding. I decided to deal with it later in an e-mail message. 17:47h Ordering boba. This was my third time interacting with a service employee, so I knew exactly what to do. I wrote what I wanted to order beforehand while I stood in line and prepared my credit card and my sign. When I was up to order, I showed my sign \u201cYo Puedo No Hablo\u201d, and he asked me \u201cwhy?\u201d. I didn\u2019t expect him to interact with me in this way and I took a moment to write \u201cexperiment\u201d (very poorly) with my non-dominant hand. I showed him the word and he gave me a thumbs up. I responded with a thumbs up and showed him the paper with my order on it. He grabbed my paper (which I also didn\u2019t expect) and wrote something on it himself. He returned the paper to me and I saw he had written \u201c4.20 Euros\u201d, what I owed him. I paid with credit card and went outside to reflect on these few unexpected responses. I typed it out to Audrey and she suggested that he might have been aware that I wasn\u2019t actually deaf because she was filming me the whole time. I hadn\u2019t thought about this before. By having someone film me for the final video, I was communicating that this was a set up (inauthentic) experience. 18:00 It\u2019s getting harder to see as it becomes dark and I have my sunglasses on. I chose to keep them on in order to fully commit to my experiment. 18:xxh Second set up for Audrey\u2019s dinner \u2026 19:03h Borka showed up and she \u2026 Pain Points & Observations: \u00b6 What are the pain points I noticed during the day? The mobile phone was HUGELY useful to me in every aspect during the day. I held it in my hand constantly and used it as a live tool to communicate with the people around me, to enhance and enlarge images that I couldn\u2019t see (were too far away), etc. At the sandwich shop, it was hard to see the digital menu that was far away. In this case, I used my mobile phone to view and enhance the images live. I noticed how much I rely on reactive and responsive communication, like sounds of acknowledgement and affirmation. And how much communication is not necessarily about the meat of the content, but all of the \u201cstuff\u201d around it. I noticed myself compensating by nodding a lot and making my gestures larger than usual (to be seen) and also lots of \u201cthumbs up\u201d. Getting people\u2019s attention. I didn\u2019t know how Observing how different people react to me in different always (from my perception) I got the sense that george was a bit uncomforatble and polite Paula was quite comfortable Audrey was very helpful and tried extra to understand.

I had explored this mode of making before (in undergrad and in my design residency) and felt comfortable and ready to jump in. A few of the scrap materials I brought were: fabric yarn, clothes hangar, a net bag used to hold bell peppers from the grocery store, cardboard, a plastic bottle, and tea bags [ Fig.1 ]. I gravitated towards the net bag and the fabric because they were flexible (and colorful) materials and I started wrapping them around different objects [ Fig.4 ]. I enjoyed how the flexible materials were able to shift forms and create variations within the same object. I decided to focus on this element of \u201cvariations\u201d in output with a common input. I reflected of the 1 minute self portrait I had drawn, which I drew with my non-dominant hand and my eyes closed (so I can better connect with my true self, and also because I can\u2019t see myself anyways). The outcome of this drawing was a rough outline of my head with all of my features (eyes, nose, and mouth) drawn outside of my head [ Fig.2 ]. I decided this person didn\u2019t use speech or sight to communicate, and that I needed to build a tool for them to communicate with touch. In the end, I came up with two simple tools: the first one using the red net, paper clip, and a plastic bottle, and the second one using a clothes hanger and fabric yarn [ Fig.5 ]. Both of these objects you can interact with and transform the shape of the materials in different degrees and variations, similar to variations in sound for speech. Within my system, tactile variations of the object will determine the message I was communicating. For example, depending on how far the clothes hangar was stretched and how far the yarns are spaced out, it would communicate a message. We also realized as a group, our machines each touched upon a different human sense [ Fig.6 ]. Unfortunately, we were the last group to present and Kristina didn\u2019t have much time to give feedback. But in her short time, she observed themes our group had in common were \u201cbecoming\u201d and \u201cunfinished explorations\u201d. I resonated with this comment because what we had made seemed to reflect our aspirations more than a tool that would be useful.

I hoped this experience would give me a small insight into understanding what a daily life and activities are like with a person with disabilities. Here are the modifications I made to my senses: Low, blurred vision I have poor vision (nearsighted) and always wear glasses to be able to see clearly. My vision on both eyes are around -3.5, which means the words I\u2019m typing on my computer screen start to get blurry if I sit straight up on my chair (1ft away). I definitely can\u2019t recognize anyone\u2019s faces unless they are also 1ft away from me, unless I know the aesthetics and behaviors of the other person, which will help me recognize them by giving me some context. Otherwise the further an object is from me, the more it looks like a blur of color with no definition or outlines. Hard of hearing I used earplugs in both of my ears to block out loud noises. ( \u201cearplugs typically have an NRR between 22 dB to 33 dB.\u201d - sleep foundation.org) Connecting with other people relies heavily on language, and lose connection with other forms of communication and expression, which may sometimes be more profound and complex. I had a friend who was deaf when I was young and we all learned a bit of sign language to communicate with that person. Since then, I was interested in the concept of using our bodies and gesture as a method of communication. Last year during the pandemic, I took an American Sign Language (ASL) course in order to improve my sign language skills and especially during a time when everyone was wearing masks and it was difficult to communicate verbally and emotionally with others. Without Speech I have a feeling taking away my ability to speak for a day might be the easiest transition for me, especially when I am alone, in a foreign country, and not in a social environment. Maybe I will challenge myself and insert myself into environments where speech is required to communicate. Lack of Hand Coordination In my drawing practice this year, I worked on a project drawing 100 insects using my non-dominant hand and found tools. The purpose of using my non-dominant hand was to let go of my tendency for perfection and overthinking when it comes to creating. I believe this tendency comes from working with my right hand (left brain) in art and design for the past 20 years, when I began studying art in an academic setting, and in the past 10 years working as a designer in a professional setting. Also, working with the computer where everything is expected to be pixel perfect. I believe we always h","title":"Goal:"},{"location":"seminars/04_Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#notes","text":"Morning at home (8am-12pm) 9:44am \u2014 I couldn\u2019t see my cat, Chicken, anywhere around our apartment and thought he could have jumped off the balcony. So I got scared and I started running to the corners of our small apartment looking for him. I really wanted to call out his name ****like I usually would when I can\u2019t find him. He doesn\u2019t always respond, but still it\u2019s something you do when you lose something that can hear. Since my sight wasn\u2019t good, I couldn\u2019t see very clearly in the dark closet and under the bed, and had to feel around with my hands. I thought I need to make a sound that would be appealing to him, so I went and got out a crinkly cat toy which made a loud noise. No response. I got a bag of treats and shook it vigorously (he lives for treats), no response. I became frustrated I couldn\u2019t make any sound\u2026 But I finally recalled his favorite (my least favorite) napping place, which is a drawer in the bathroom where we keep the fresh laundered towels. And sure enough, there he was. Because I couldn\u2019t see well, I touched him to confirm it was him. am \u2014 I heard a noise coming from the bathroom, and I ran there and saw brown stuff on top of the toilet seat, which I knew was dirt (context), and my cat Chicken (oval grey thing), running out of the bathroom. I followed after him and he ran under the bed (because he knew he did something bad). I wanted to scold him and say, \u201cchicken, no! Bad boy!\u201d, which is what I usually do when he does something bad, but I couldn\u2019t use my voice, so I just slapped the ground with my hand as an expression of my frustration and to make a loud noise for him to hear. 11:30am \u2014 I realize my home has become too safe, so I decided to go on a walk and expose myself and see what other challenges I run into in the wild. I thought since speech is a very social tool, I needed to engage in social environments. So I texted the MDEF group chat to see if anyone wanted to join me on a walk through the city. Paula, Paula, Georges, and Borka responded. And I planned to meet Georges in Poblenou to start. I will be leaving my glasses home, despite my discomfort, so I can fully commit and not retreat to it when I become uncomfortable. 13:00h - Went out of the house to meet Geroge at Iaac. Vision was the sense I was relying on most heavily here. It was difficult trying to avoid stepping on poop on the ground, since I had trouble seeing. Normally, I would cross the street on a red light if there were no cars passing. I noticed myself relying a lot on other people on the street (since they were large masses and could easily be seen) watching other people to see if I should cross the street on a red light . I reinserted my ear plugs properly and I can hear significantly less. With my earplugs in, it was harder to identify sounds and the distance of the sounds. 13:06h - Waiting for George outside of Iaac, it\u2019s difficult to see the faces of people who are approaching. I keep looking at them wondering if it\u2019s him, and it probably looks strange. I feel glad I wore my sunglasses, it makes me feel safer and less seen. 13:11h - Ordering coffee. I showed the sign that says \u201cNo Puedo Hablar Hoy\u201d and pointed at the word \u201ccortado\u201d on the menu. He understood and gave me a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and proceeded with the transaction as normal but without saying anything. The card reader didn\u2019t work so he banged on the other ones and for some reason I understood that as frustration towards me. This transaction made me self conscious. 13:18h I think George is feeling uncomfortable. We walk to Cituidella park to meet up with Paula 14:12h Meet with Paula who is planting seeds around the city. 14:40h We find a cafe near the Arc de Triumph to grab some food, charge our phone, and join the class online. Ordering food: I get a sense that the workers here do not expect that I cannot speak, hear or see well. When I showed her the sign, I got the sense that she was a bit annoyed. I had to take some time to write what I wanted to order on the piece of paper because I was using my non-dominant hand. She left the counter for a few seconds and then returned when I finished. I ordered a sandwich and a juice and payed by card. 15:10h We took class on iPad at a cafe. I found myself moving closer to the iPad because I couldn\u2019t hear very well and when people were commenting, I had to move close to see what the text was. Aparna commented on my look through a personal text, which made me feel silly. 15:30h A man came up and asked for something in Spanish, I couldn\u2019t understand but I also couldn\u2019t respond with sound. Helpless I looked at Paula, and she looked up and shook her head and said \u201cno\u201d 15:36h We decided to head out and walk towards Audrey\u2019s kitchen before it starts raining. Being in a busy part of town, we passed by many stores that looked interesteing but I couldn\u2019t read the signs, and that made me frustrated. Normally, I would look up the store names as I pass by them on my google map and pin them so I can return to them in the future. I felt like I was missing out on future pleasures. 15:53h I asked Paula if the metro ticket was okay (to use for the bus) and she misunderstood me suggesting she uses my metro ticket too. I understood her misunderstanding through what she said, but I wasn\u2019t fast enough to communicate this to her by typing it on my phone. I let it go. 16:34h \u2014 We are now out in Saint Antoni to come to Audrey\u2019s kitchen. We joined Mariana and Audrey here. With more than one person around, I\u2019m finding it more difficult to insert myself in a group setting. Conversations are happening really fast and reactively, and I\u2019m not finding time for me to chime in. 16:17h - I saw Paula touching all of the figs on the table and I wanted to tell her not to touch all of the figs. I couldn\u2019t scold her with my voice so I tapped her hands (gently) but firmly, letting her know that it\u2019s not okay. It was taken with a sense of humor and we laughed about it. I wrote \u201cyou dirty hands\u201d on the piece of paper with my non-dominant hand and showed it to her. 17:17h We decided to go to a bubble tea shop. As we were walking, we lost Audrey and I was the only one who saw her walk the other way. I wanted to yell at her to let her to get her attention, but I couldn\u2019t. Instinctively, I started snapping my fingers like I did with the cats this morning, but it wasn\u2019t loud enough. I panicked a little I felt helpless and ran towards Paula and marina to tap their shoulders to let them know and they called her. It was frustrating. 17:25h It\u2019s 5 minutes before my 1:1 meeting with Angella and the Zoom app on my phone isn\u2019t working. Paula, Mariana, and Audrey are inside a boba shop. I hurry in and tap the shoulder of Audrey who is the closest to the door and hand her my phone where I typed \u201cCan I use your phone for the meeting? Mine isn\u2019t working\u201d. She said her batteries were low and she called out to Marina, who gave me her phone to use. 17:30h Meeting with Angella. I showed her my sign (in english) and she started writing a sign to show me. I messaged her in chat and told her we should talk in chat for the sake of time, and she asked me if it was okay if others can see it. I said I didn\u2019t mind and we continued our converstaion through chat. I told her what I was doing and asked her if she knew any American Sign Language. She told me she knew \u201cmilk\u201d and \u201cmore\u201d. She mostly stayed silent and communicated with chat although she was able to speak back to me over the call. At the end of the call she said, \u201cBye, Marina\u201d and I realized that she had thought I was Marina because I was using her phone. I wasn\u2019t quick enough with typing to let her know before I left the call. I was frustrated that she mistook me as Marina and I felt helpless that I couldn\u2019t say anything to correct her misunderstanding. I decided to deal with it later in an e-mail message. 17:47h Ordering boba. This was my third time interacting with a service employee, so I knew exactly what to do. I wrote what I wanted to order beforehand while I stood in line and prepared my credit card and my sign.
