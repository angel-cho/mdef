Born in South Korea and raised between two countries, she grew up immersed in traditional Eastern and modern Western cultures. Interested in social psychology and art from an early age, she decided to study graphic design at the Rhode Island School of Design. This lead to her career in working for graphic design consultancies, teaching typography, and most recently, creating engaging interactive experiences for exhibition spaces. Parallel to her design career, Angel pursued less conventional paths in meditation and pottery. She studied under potters in Okinawa, Japan, and in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. She also formed a practice in zen meditation and the Japanese Tea Ceremony while living in a Buddhist Monastery in Northern California. She continues to find ways to weave these practices into her creative work. Angel is currently based in Barcelona, Spain, pursuing her Masters in Design for Emergent Futures at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia.

In thinking about this topic, I found myself looking back at the trajectory of my life and career with the context of technological development and the cultural and personal shifts it created. I\u2019m still exploring what \u201cmy fight\u201d is, but I\u2019m very interested in the interplay between technology and humans and also the opportunities it can provide in giving access and tools to marginalized communities and individuals. Reflections: Have more conversations with others about their passions and pursuits Distill my ideas down to the essense Work on presentation skills Professional Identity We took time to reflect on our skills, knowledge and attitude and share these with a few of our classmates \u201cspeed-dating style\u201d. I enjoyed this exercise because it gave us a context to share and it allowed us to just jump right into it. I learned something new with each person I spoke to and also picked up some attributes I would like to have. Professional Development Plan Having the entire syllabus for term 1 in hand, I\u2019m excited and curious to see what I will learn. I found myself questioning a lot of the topics and I think that\u2019s good because it means I will be learning something new. I think I will be surprised to compare notes after the fact. Reflections: - How can I combine this with my \u201cfight\u201d to plan out my project and goals?
