In thinking about this topic, I found myself looking back at the trajectory of my life and career with the context of technological development and the cultural and personal shifts it created. I\u2019m still exploring what \u201cmy fight\u201d is, but I\u2019m very interested in the interplay between technology and humans and also the opportunities it can provide in giving access and tools to marginalized communities and individuals.

I enjoyed this exercise because it gave us a context to share and it allowed us to just jump right into it. I learned something new with each person I spoke to and also picked up some attributes I would like to have. Professional Development Plan Having the entire syllabus for term 1 in hand, I\u2019m excited and curious to see what I will learn. I found myself questioning a lot of the topics and I think that\u2019s good because it means I will be learning something new. I think I will be surprised to compare notes after the fact.
