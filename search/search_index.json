Hybrid Profiles Personal Development Program Reflections What is my fight? In our first week of MDEF program, we met the faculties, visited the facilities and the Poblenou neighborhood, and was introduced to the structure of the program. Our first exercise was to reflect on the question \u201cWhat is my fight?\u201d and create a poster to share with the group. In my poster, I visualized my journey through my personal and professional life in the context of technology. I chose the lens of technology because it had and continues to have a large impact it on my personal life, our culture and society, my design career, and our collective future. In summary, I grew up with the evolution of technology and the internet and have had very mixed feeling about the ethics of technology. At different times of my life, I embraced and rejected working with or buying into the culture of tech, but have now come to a place where I see technology as a tool I must understand and manipulate to make impact in the future. And I believe the best way technology has made an impact in our society is through elevating equality; by providing new opportunities and access to marginalized communities and individuals who may not have had access before. Hybrid Profiles We learned about designing from a first person perspective and the importance of engaging with community early on in our design process. The sample (India light) project project was a great example of how as designers, we are often \u201csolving\u201d design problems in our own heads and ultimately designing for ourselves instead of the actual client or audience. We often fall into the trap of seeing ourselves as creators and problem solvers and the world as a big problem we need to solve. When the reality is that our minds our limited and the connections and sparks we can generate through real-life engagement and interactions (people, places and things), can provide a depth of understanding, relevance, and unimagined pathways that we could not have thought of alone. blockquote \u201cThe professional identity is deduced from the role you typically take in a design process, your strengths and weaknesses as a designer. Your professional identity is constantly developing.\u201d - Oscar Tomico Following this lecture, we learned about the importance of understanding ourselves (our skills, knowledge and attitudes) on a professional level, and our aspirations. We jotted down our professional identities, then shared our qualities with our classmates, one on one. With each share, I learned a new quality of a classmate and picked up a quality that I would like to have. This exercise provided a good platform to share about ourselves in ways that we normally wouldn\u2019t. Personal Development Program Syntax Description Test Text Header Title Here\u2019s this Paragraph Text And more We also applied this method to our term one course list, and reflected on what skills, knowledge and attitudes we would like to acquire through each course. There are many topics in term one I am curious and excited to learn about. It will be interesting to return to this chart in hindsight and compare notes with my learnings.

Who are we? Which future? What are we talking about? Listening to Mariana\u2019s personal journey, I resonated with her insight in discovering human metaphors behind all aspects of technology. The example of the ancient memory board artifact was especially fascinating because it was so visually and conceptually similar to the circuit boards we make today. It made me feel humble and a part of something larger, in an ancestral lineage of humans that are working to create and preserve their stories. \"Cognitive ecologies instead of cognitive supremacies\" - Mariana Quintero Design Space \u00b6 We were introduced to our design spaces on Miro, a working space we will be using throughout the program to map out our ideas, findings, experiments, and feedback. We started getting acquainted with this space through a card game. We had to pick a topic card we cared about, then blindly select a series of other topic cards, and create meaningful connections between the cards. Having the pre-written cards were helpful in giving form to abstract ideas. I enjoyed the format of the game, and thought it was a great way to engage and teach a system. On day 2 we went on a hike in Collserola Natural Park, on the outskirts of Barcelona. We were prompted to picked a card to take with us and reflect on during our hike. I chose \u201cEmotional Tech\u201d. I\u2019ve always seen this \u201cgreen area\u201d on google maps, but haven\u2019t made it out there yet so was excited to explore. Our early morning hike was full of surprises; we explored unmarked trails, tasted wild berries, identified new plants, exchanged ideas, walked in silence, and received a great talk from a park ranger at the peak of our hike. Some reflections from our conversation: Relationship of the city to the forest. Living in a capitalistic society, we have the tendency to want to build, expand, and grow our citites. But how does this affect the ecosystem and other species that have previously lived in the urban areas or currently live around it? The significance of seeing something vs \u201cnothing\u201d; for example a forest vs a field. I had never thought about the importance of visual scale in determining our values in this way. The park ranger brought up the topic of humans building on empty fields because they see the empty land as an opportunity to \u201cbuild on\u201d. In contrast, a forest full of trees and larger species is seen as something to be saved or preserved. But what we don\u2019t realize is that ecosystems and other organisms like birds depend on fields to feed and survive. How can we discourage people from moving to cities? This was an interesting topic to have post covid, when our view of workspace and home space have shifted tremendously. In the past year, many people have already migrated to the countrysides seeking nature, more space, and since remote work became a long-term possibility. My card: Emotional Technology \u00b6 I chose this card because the words resonated with me, but I didn\u2019t actually know its official meaning. After doing some research, I learned that Emotional Tech refers to technology that recognizes and uses human emotions (usually through biometric data) to improve their outputs and services. Some reflections I had during my day with this card: Can we use the input as emotions from other species besides humans? Shift the human-centered perspective How can emo tech improve our relationship with our surroundings The ways we relate to each other in a city environment What do we mean when we say \u201cbetter\u201d experience or world. Do we define \u201cbetter\u201d as easier or more convenient? If everything is more convenient, are we missing out on the revelations and discoveries that inconvenience and random curve balls life throws us? My Design Space \u00b6 Having so many great options, it was difficult to choose a few cards that represented my pursuit. I definitely resonate with the \u201chotel buffet syndrome\u201d as Mariana calls it. But I tried to remember to trust my instincts and make intuitive decisions. I chose the cards \u201cFight Anthropocene Conflicts\u201d and \u201cInter-species Collaboration\u201d because I\u2019m interested in the human-ness of these issues and also exploring other perspectives outside of the human species. In our collaboration exercise, was good to hear other\u2019s perspectives. I feel like we spent most of the time trying to negotiate our definitions of the group. Everyone had something slightly different in mind and wanted to get on the same page. I think it\u2019s really difficult to let go of your personal identity or ideas esp in this world today where our identities are\u2026 It reminds me of a zen story: when a group of hippies arrived at the San Francisco Zen Center in the 70\u2019s, the senior monk, Suzuki Roshi told them to get out of their individual clothing and and accessories and change into shaved heads and black robes.
