Introduction to the faculties, facilities, neighborhoods, communities, and the structure of the MDEF program.


<h3>"What is my flight?"</h3>

We were encouraged to ask ourselves "What is my flight?" and create a poster that reflects this question. In thinking about this topic, I found myself looking back at the trajectory of my life and career with the context of technological development and the cultural and personal shifts it created.

I'm still exploring what "my fight" is, but I'm very interested in the interplay between technology and humans and also the opportunities it can provide in giving access and tools to marginalized communities and individuals.

<b>Reflections:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Have more conversations with others about their passions and pursuits</li>
  <li>Distill my ideas down to the essense</li>
  <li>Work on presentation skills</li>
</ul>


<h2>Professional Identity</h2>

We took time to reflect on our skills, knowledge and attitude and share these with a few of our classmates "speed-dating style". I enjoyed this exercise because it gave us a context to share and it allowed us to just jump right into it. I learned something new with each person I spoke to and also picked up some attributes I would like to have.


<h2>Professional Development Plan</h2>

Having the entire syllabus for term 1 in hand, I'm excited and curious to see what I will learn. I found myself questioning a lot of the topics and I think that's good because it means I will be learning something new. I think I will be surprised to compare notes after the fact.

**Reflections:**
- How can I combine this with my "fight" to plan out my project and goals?
