### New Way of Documenting
*A reflection on how you are documenting and communicating your work currently, and how you will approach this moving forward in the master. To be included on your website at the end of the week.*

So far in the program, documenting my process and work has been mainly an afterthought. I've been overwhelmed with new information, activities, and assignments, I just take out my camera when I remember to and take a quick photograph of the process. I try to document quickly so I don't disturb the flow of the activity or lesson. When I return to these photos at the end of the week for my website reflections, it requires a bit of time to sort through them and make them consistent and organized for public use.

Moving forward, I would like to create a system for documenting that is non-disruptive to my learning / design process and consistent in format. I love the idea of documentation being a core part of the process and more than just an afterthought. The exercise of the guided "meditations" gave me some insight into possibilities of using different formats to document. This week I have been trying out several methods (haven't landed on one yet), but here are some of my explorations:

1. Making recordings to my future self with questions or suggestions I have in the present.
2. Recording sounds that will give
3.
