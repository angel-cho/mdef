### New Way of Documenting
*A reflection on how you are documenting and communicating your work currently, and how you will approach this moving forward in the master.*

Unfortunately, documenting my work has become an afterthought during these first few months of the program. I've been deeply engaged in learning new things and haven't found a great way to integrate documentation into my process. I have been taking photographs as I remember to, and try to do it quickly so I don't disturb the flow of the activity. But when I return to these photos at the end of the week for my reflections, I find they are inconsistent and require time to sort through to find a narrative structure. The same goes for my end of the week reflections on my website. I realize there's a disconnect between my weekly experiences and my documentation and communication of them.

Moving forward, I would like to create a system for documenting that is non-intrusive to my process while representing my work in a way that feels authentic. I love the idea that documenting can be a part of the work itself and not an additional task. I'm interested in exploring different documenting methods (active, passive, sound, visual, using different tools) to see which resonates most and if it makes sense to combine a few. Most importantly, the system has to be intuitive (not take too much extra effort) and also accessible to others in the end. I can imagine that some of these experiments sound interesting, but may not prove to be sustainable.

Methods to explore this week:
1. Making voice recordings to my future self (emotional and mental states)
2. Recording biometric data via apple watch (passive data)
3. Taking a photo every hour paired with a sound recording every hour (somehow automated)
4. Screen recordings
