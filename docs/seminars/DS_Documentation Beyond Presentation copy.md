### New Way of Documenting
*A reflection on how you are documenting and communicating your work currently, and how you will approach this moving forward in the master.*

Unfortunately, documenting my work has become an afterthought during these first few months of the program. I've been deeply engaged in learning new things and haven't found a great way to integrate documentation into my process. I have been taking photographs as I remember to, and try to do it quickly so I don't disturb the flow of the activity. But when I return to these photos at the end of the week for my reflections, I find they are inconsistent and require time to sort through to make sense from.

Moving forward, I would like to create a system for documenting that is consistent and non-disruptive to my learning and design process. I love the idea of weaving the act of documentation into the process of design. I tried to experiment with some different methods of documenting this week. I haven't landed on a single method yet, but have been exploring:

1. Making recordings to my future self with questions or suggestions I have in the present
2. Quick blind drawings with clear labels
3. Taking a photo every hour 
4. Recording a snippit of sound every hour
