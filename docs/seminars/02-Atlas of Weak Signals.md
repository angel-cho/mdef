# Atlas of Weak Signals
11-15 October 2021

with Mariana Quintero

<h2>Reflections</h2>


This week we learned to identify "weak signals", or indicators of a potentially emerging issues that can be used to think about alternate futures. Listening to Mariana's personal journey, I found her perspective on technological metaphors interesting. In particular the idea that human culture is embedded in all aspects of our creation, including technology. And this is something worth looking at and reflecting on.

On day 2 we went on a hike in Collserola Natural Park, on the outskirts of Barcelona. We picked a card to take with us and reflect on during our hike; I chose "Emotional Tech". The hike was full of positive surprises, we explored unmarked trails, tasted wild berries, identified plants, exchanged stimulating conversations, walked in silence, and received an amazing talk from a park ranger about the natural habitat of the area. My takeaways:
- I thought the relationship of the city to the forest was important. Living in a capitalistic society, we have the tendency to want to build, expand, and grow. And this is mostly the outlook of any city. But how does this affect the ecosystem and other species that have previously lived in the urban areas or currently live around it?
- I had never thought about the visual significance of something vs nothing in terms of ... I had never thought about the importance of scale in determining what we see as valuable. The park ranger brought up the topic of humans building on empty fields because they see the empty land and see it as an opportunity to build something on. Vs. when they see a forest, they see trees and larger species that need to be preserved or saved. When actually, the fields help the biodivesity of the birds and etc. These kinds of revelations really shift my perspective.
- how can we discourage people from moving to cities. interesting topic to have post covid, when a lot of people have been migrating to the countrysides after remote work became a long-term possibility.

Emotional technology
- when technologies learn and recognize human emotions and use that knowledge to improve outputs and services. Using biometric data and connecting products to eachother
- keep thinking about what the point of it all is. What do we mean when we say "better" experience or world. Do we define "better" as easier or more convenient? If everything is more convenient, are we missing out on the revelations and discoveries that inconvenience and random curve balls life throws us?

My 1:1 meeting with Mariana was valuable although I wish we had more time. I was encouraged that she was interested in my work and thought that my past work and interests and what I had in mind to pursue was in alignment. It's super valuable to get different perspectives because other people with other experiences can sometimes make the connection that I'm not able to in my mind. And open doors to explore new connections.

Being indecisive, it was difficult to choose a few cards from the myriad of interesting topics. But this was a great exercise to practice making intuitive decisions. Sometimes I forget the knowledge I have built through experience that exists on a subconscious level and depend too much on my thinking process.

I chose "Fight Anthropocene Conflicts" because I was interested in issues created by humans that humans suffer.

"Inter-species Collaboration" because I am interested in how and what we can learn from other species.

This exercise was tricky. I found myself googling a lot of terms

    * Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales.

In our collaboration exercise, was good to hear other's perspectives. I feel like we spent most of the time trying to negotiate our definitions of the group. Everyone had something slightly different in mind and wanted to get on the same page. I think it's really difficult to let go of your personal identity or ideas esp in this world today where our identities are... It reminds me of a zen story: when a group of hippies arrived at the San Francisco Zen Center in the 70's, the senior monk, Suzuki Roshi told them to get out of their individual clothing and and accessories and change into shaved heads and black robes. That when they all had
